# [Healthyness](https://healthyness.pythonanywhere.com)

This project was made for a [Tech-With-Tim](https://discord.gg/twt) codejam.



# Introduction

Healthyness is a website where you can keep yourself healthy and fit. You can see the number of Covid cases in your country. See the amount of sugar consumed. Stay fit by doing yoga and listen to your inner mind and keep yourself mentally healthy too.

# Usage
To get started, head over to our website - [Healthyness](https://healthyness.pythonanywhere.com). This is the URL [https://healthyness.pythonanywhere.com](https://healthyness.pythonanywhere.com). You can use our website without registering yourself, but we do recommend you to register yourself for using the features to the fullest. For doing yoga, you can add your points and fight with other and see who did the most that day.

## Tools used

This project was made possible using `Python 3.9.` But for 1 feature, I have used `Javascript`. 

### About me
Hi, I am Aryan and I am in 8th grade and I am 13 years old. During this time, I needed to study a lot too, and I found it a challenge to create this website. So, if this is the judges seeing, please take my website into consideration. I have worked real hard for this.
